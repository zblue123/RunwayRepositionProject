README: 

TO generate results, place Python file and Excel file with aircraft information in the same folder and run the file.  No input arguments are needed. 

Model values such as fuelCost, parameter size, population size, and the number of generations are global variables that can be changed at the top of the file. 

To view output data, run the file and then in the same directory open "output.xls".  The last column represents the cost value, and the first 72 columns represent the parameter values from that iteration. 

This file was created using Spyder and Python 3.6.
